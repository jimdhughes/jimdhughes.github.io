I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned it in previous articles but I&amp;rsquo;ve finally done it. I got my PMP. The whole process really highlighted a few personality traits that I&amp;rsquo;ve developed at recently in my life. They&amp;rsquo;re essentially as follows:
I pursue so many things in an effort to claim that I&amp;rsquo;m too busy. I hate.. hate failing I have too many ideas Since starting down my career path, I&amp;rsquo;ve made some massive changes to my demeanour.</description></item><item><title>&lt;Thoughts> Print vs Media - Hoof</title><link>/posts/2018/thought-how-im-anti-tech/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Feb 2018 00:15:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2018/thought-how-im-anti-tech/</guid><description>TLDR; I learned to memorize by reading and writing paper content I learned to look up using digital content. I find myself continually using indexing and ctrl-f to find information in digital content whereas I actually read and commit to memory when I read physical text and write physical notes.
Lessons I learned once and apparently have forgotten since

As I sit here in my office I wonder what happened? I&amp;rsquo;ve gone from completing real actionable items daily to feeling like I&amp;rsquo;m just spinning my tires again, but I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not. Since my first day back to work of 2018, I&amp;rsquo;ve successfully:
Implemented a prototype for a potential new internal project Furthermore I&amp;rsquo;ve had 1 sit-down meeting to demo the application sprints and 3 meaningful conversations around alignment of the processes we&amp;rsquo;re looking to automate.</description></item></channel></rss>
