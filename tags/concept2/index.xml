      <description>&lt;p&gt;In February 2018, I received a service award from work and decided that I would use it to purchase a cardio machine of some sort for my basement gym.  I used to go the the gym at my work all the time but once I had a child and my wife returned back to work after mat leave, that option had fallen by the wayside real quick!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I applaud those who can get themselves out of bed after only four hours of sleep. However, my drive for that quickly waned as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
