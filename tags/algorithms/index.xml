      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dotnet Core, Golang, Node, C, Java, Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I felt like doing on a Tuesday night after seeing yet another article discussing the performance of dotnet core over node.js.  As is typical when things like these arise, our team&amp;rsquo;s slack channel went into the lightest of debates about C# vs Node, compiled speeds vs interpreted languages, and finally back to what we were originally discussing - &amp;ldquo;Do you think cypress would be faster than selenium?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;48 days ago I signed up for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/&#34;&gt;https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t completed all 48 problems however the ones that I have completed, I&amp;rsquo;ve had a blast with.  It bring back a challenge that&amp;rsquo;s been missing - not that my work and personal life don&amp;rsquo;t have their own challenges.  It brings me back to basics and gets me thinking again on algorithm design and optimization of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of my development work (which is less and less these days) is done using a framework of some sort which puts a layer of &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo; on top of the coding experience.  I&amp;rsquo;ve actually recently gotten a little miffed at just how much &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo; is built into a toolset and have determined that too much &amp;lsquo;magic&amp;rsquo; is killing the next generation of developers - but that is a topic for a different day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
