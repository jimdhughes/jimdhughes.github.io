I&amp;rsquo;m used to storing data in localstorage which is okay&amp;hellip; sometimes. When you have a small amount of data to store such as user settings or persisting filters between views then this is a decent enough solution. I was working on a project recently that had a wild requirement appear where we needed to store upwards of 10k items offline. Needless to say, this put performance problems in our application.</description></item></channel></rss>
