I used to go the the gym at my work all the time but once I had a child and my wife returned back to work after mat leave, that option had fallen by the wayside real quick!</p><p>I applaud those who can get themselves out of bed after only four hours of sleep. However, my drive for that quickly waned as well.</p><p>My basement has the basics - a stoable weight bench (that can go as high as a squat rack and as low as a decline bench press would require), a bar, a few hundred pounds of plate weights, and a curl bar. I have a doorway mounted chinup bar and a few yoga maps for floor exercises.</p><p>The problem - my drive!</p><p>I liked going to the gym because I had competition. My gym buddies who I would <strong>have</strong> to meet every morning which made it so I <strong>had</strong> to get out of bed. When left to my own devices (much like most people) I tend to defer and procastinate. That is, until I found methods to keep myself focused.</p><p>I started logging my workouts, weights, and the like on JetFit. This helped with my tracking but got REALLY tedious REALLY fast. I also found that while my muscle strength was growing, my cardio strength felt like it was <em>declining</em>. I started chasing my boy around the park and found myself short of breath! I am not <strong>that</strong> overweight, I don&rsquo;t think &ndash; but the struggle was real.</p><p>I did some research and was about to buy a water rower and then I spoke to a colleague at work about my plan and he immediately recommended the Concept2 Model D rower. I hadn&rsquo;t even heard of the brand! Some research <strong>QUICKLY</strong> lead me to learn that they were the brand for me. So I headed over to Amazon and ordered one with my awesome prime account for quick free shipping.</p><p>I set it up and downlaoded the <a href=http://www.concept2.com/service/software/ergdata target=_blank>ErgData</a> app for my iPhone and synced it to my monitor and did a quick row. I learned a few things</p><ol><li>I was madly out of shape</li><li>I loved this thing</li></ol><p>THE DATA!
Oh my lawd, the data. I didn&rsquo;t even know what most of it meant but it gave me something to self-monitor and track.</p><p>ErgData syncs with the online logbook located <a href=https://log.concept2.com target=_blank>here</a> and I&rsquo;ll show you a nice little snipped of my first few days of rowing:</p><p><img src=/content/images/2018/05/Capture.PNG alt="First Few Days of Rowing"></p><p>Yep - OMFG is right.
My first 2k meters left me gasping for air for a solid 35 minutes.
MY first 5k meters left me burning and wheezing for almost an hour!</p><p>However this gave me something to chase - I could now combat myself!</p><h2 id=aside>Aside!</h2><p>The online logbook lets me sync up with my fitbit account. I use the Charge HR 2 but REALLY want the Ionic. This automatically adds the rows into my fitbit exercise log for the day and identifies all the key components automatically. What a world we live in! I also went ahead and ordered a Garmin Heartrate belt to sync to the PM5 - I&rsquo;ll let you know the delta in FitBit&rsquo;s calculated HR and the belts HR in a later post!</p><p>Through the month of March I competed in the &lsquo;Mud Season Madness&rsquo; challenge - and boy was it.
For 25 days complete at least 5000m.</p><p>As you can see from my first chart, my 5k wasn&rsquo;t great. and my depressing notes on it were not very uplifting - but I was dedicated!!</p><p>It took me a while, but I eventually got my time down to a respectable level - I think! Below are my &lsquo;Event&rsquo; Rankings which have gotten MUCH better since my original attempts!</p><p><img src=/content/images/2018/05/Capture-2.PNG alt="My Rankings"></p><p>Now - admittedly I&rsquo;ve been slacking since Mud Season Madness ended but I&rsquo;m still trying to get in at least 3 days a week on this ERG. In fact, last night I did my first 2k challenge of the 2018/19 season and finished with a time of 7:26.1 which is a far cry from my record, but still not that terrible!</p><p>Ready for some results?
Here&rsquo;s my February - April weight loss from having a dedicated, push myself challenge. It&rsquo;s the first time in YEARS that I&rsquo;ve successfully dropped below 230 lbs! Another awesome integration and data porn brought to you by the Fitbit team in the form of the Fitbit Aria</p><p><img src=/content/images/2018/05/Capture-3.PNG alt="Weight Loss Trend"></p><p>This device does literally everything for me and my goals.</p><ol><li>It targets a load of muscles in the body</li><li>It&rsquo;s relatively low impact so my awful knees don&rsquo;t scream at me when I&rsquo;m finished</li><li>The data! It keeps me motivated</li></ol><p>I know I typically talk about tech and building it, but sometimes I just really need to talk about how well other people are building it. There&rsquo;s so much opportunity to modernize the tasks we do every day and buying this rower reaffirmed my belief in that. Industries are ready to be disrupted!</p><p>I promise my next post will be more technology oriented.</p><p>Perhaps something to deal with my current love / hate relationship with Golang.</p><p>Until then!</p></article><section class="article labels"><a class=category href=/categories/concept2/>Concept2</a><a class=category href=/categories/pm5/>PM5</a><a class=category href=/categories/fitness/>Fitness</a><a class=category href=/categories/data/>Data</a><a class=tag href=/tags/concept2/>Concept2</a><a class=tag href=/tags/pm5/>PM5</a><a class=tag href=/tags/fitness/>Fitness</a><a class=tag href=/tags/data/>Data</a></section></div><div class="article bottom"><section class="article navigation"><p><a class=link href=/async-/-await-in-node.js/><span class="iconfont icon-article"></span>Async / Await in Node.js</a></p><p><a class=link href=/yet-another-stateless-authentication-blog-post-for-the-mean-stack./><span class="iconfont icon-article"></span>Yet Another Stateless Authentication Blog Post for the MEAN stack.</a></p></section></div></section><section id=footer><div class=footer-wrap><p class=copyright>Â©2020 James Hughes.</p><p class=powerby><span>Powered by </span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a><span> and the </span><a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/ target=_blank>Notepadium</a></p></div></section><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;ga('create','UA-61647183-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script></body></html>
