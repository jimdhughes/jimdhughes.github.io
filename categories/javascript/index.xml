I&amp;rsquo;m used to storing data in localstorage which is okay&amp;hellip; sometimes. When you have a small amount of data to store such as user settings or persisting filters between views then this is a decent enough solution.

Needless to say, this put performance problems in our application.</description></item><item><title>Yet Another Stateless Authentication Blog Post for the MEAN stack.</title><link>/yet-another-stateless-authentication-blog-post-for-the-mean-stack./</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 May 2018 03:32:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>/yet-another-stateless-authentication-blog-post-for-the-mean-stack./</guid><description>#inb4: this ain&amp;rsquo;t new.
I&amp;rsquo;m writing this for everyone that wants a slightly more organized approach to express middleware and authentication. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this because once again I was inspired by how much I adore Node, Express, and all the delights that come from being able to implement my API&amp;rsquo;s and leverage middlewares. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m using async / await, which is pretty neat.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to use MongoDB as a datastore it just jives so well with Node.</description></item></channel></rss>
