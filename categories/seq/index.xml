The system, when deployed, will have 3 components living on 3 different servers with their networks locked down. You can think of it like:
a &amp;mdash; b &amp;mdash; c
Server a can talk to server b, b to a and c, and c to b.
To test these without deploying to the actual environment, I figured I may as well dockerize it!</description></item></channel></rss>
