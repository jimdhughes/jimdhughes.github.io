      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was upgrading ArcGIS Server (10.6.1 -&amp;gt; 10.7) the other day&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encountered an issue with the account ArcGIS was using to run itself - the LocalSystem account. We don&amp;rsquo;t have passwords for it, so the installer would not let us proceed. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t change the user either which posed a bit of an issue so we decided to just cancel our install and proceed along our merry way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we turned our ArcGIS Server service back on and gave it a few minutes to spin back up however it never did! We hunted through our logs and didn&amp;rsquo;t see much to indicate what might have happened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
