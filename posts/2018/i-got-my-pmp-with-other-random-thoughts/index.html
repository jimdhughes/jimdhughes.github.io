I&rsquo;ve mentioned it in previous articles but I&rsquo;ve finally done it.  I got my PMP.
The whole process really highlighted a few personality traits that I&rsquo;ve developed at recently in my life.  They&rsquo;re essentially as follows:

I pursue so many things in an effort to claim that I&rsquo;m too busy.
I hate.. hate failing
I have too many ideas

Since starting down my career path, I&rsquo;ve made some massive changes to my demeanour. I used to be very technical.  I wanted to be extremely proficient in one thing.  I thought that this would be what sets me apart and what makes me indispensable.  I&rsquo;m now about 7 years in and I&rsquo;ve taken such a drastic turn that I had to look back hard to determine where it happened and why."><meta name=author content="James D Hughes"><link rel=canonical href=https://blog.jimdhughes.com/posts/2018/i-got-my-pmp-with-other-random-thoughts/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.45e028aa8ce0961349adf411b013ee39406be2c0bc80d4ea3fc04555f7f4611a.css integrity="sha256-ReAoqozglhNJrfQRsBPuOUBr4sC8gNTqP8BFVff0YRo=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://blog.jimdhughes.com/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://blog.jimdhughes.com/favicon-16x16.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://blog.jimdhughes.com/favicon-32x32.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://blog.jimdhughes.com/apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://blog.jimdhughes.com/safari-pinned-tab.svg><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://blog.jimdhughes.com/posts/2018/i-got-my-pmp-with-other-random-thoughts/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-0ET0VYDXCL"></script><script>window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-0ET0VYDXCL")</script><meta property="og:url" content="https://blog.jimdhughes.com/posts/2018/i-got-my-pmp-with-other-random-thoughts/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="James Hughes"><meta property="og:title" content="I got my PMP!
