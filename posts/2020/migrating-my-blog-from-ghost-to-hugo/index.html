I first started my blog in an attempt to ‘practice what I preach’ to my peers and young minds that I was hoping to help mould for the best. I think that every developer should have their own blog. Not in a vain attempt to get clicks or ad revenue, but to keep a log of that tough-to-diagnose error that they tried for weeks to diagnose and fix. My blog acts a lot as a personal reference for issues I’ve faced in my coding life and what I did to get around them.\nIn a silly attempt to get approved for google ads, I deleted several very helpful-for-me posts that google flagged as being too short to allow me to enable ads on my site for. So I deleted them. This is the only real regret I have in my blogging life.\nANYWAYS\nThat’s why I blog. This is also partially the reason why I’ve switched from Ghost to Hugo. I was hoping to set up google ads on my blog to help pay for my hosting costs. Since I couldn’t get approved for ads, I started exploring different paths.\nGithub Pages Github Pages is an offering that allows you to publish a website using git. The name pretty much says it all. The best part: It’s free! The genearl idea is:\nCreate a new repository that looks like [yourusername].github.io Clone the repo Add an index.html file with some content Commit and push Navigate to [yourusername].github.io and boom, you have a website! Based on my understanding, github pages does a great job at hosting up static html files. Since my current blog runs on Ghost which is a client/server architecture, I would need to migrate my blog to a static site generator so I can make use of Github Pages.\nSince I have fallen in lust with go, and Hugo is, by their own definition\nThe world’s fastest framework for building websites\nI decided to give it a go!\nSetting up Hugo Since I use my macbook for everything non work-related, I used homebrew to install hugo. There are several installation options located on hugo’s official getting started pages but I elected to use the trusty homebrew option.\nbrew install hugo Once that’s all done, you can create a new site by running\nhugo new site myepicblog Next you should initialize your git repo and add a theme. I’m using the theme hugo-notepadium. You can either clone the themes and commit them with your code or use the snazzy git submodules to load it up during your build phase. I elect to load it during the build phase.\ncd myepicblog git submodule add https://github.com/cntrump/hugo-notepadium.git themes/hugo-notepadium You can see what you’ve got happening by running hugo server and navigating to localhost:1313 You should see a static site and some content. Sweet! Our Hugo site is running.\nMigrating content I started to cringe at the idea of manually moving my content from Ghost to Hugo. Ghost’s content is stored as markdown Hugo’s page setup is, as expected, all stored in Markdown while Ghost relies on a database to organize content. Luckily the community came to the rescue! Ghost provides a list of tools developed by the community to help you migrate from different engines to hugo. Luckily, ghostToHugo was there to save my day.\nSnag a backup of your ghost blog Log in to the admin portion of your ghost blog and perform a backup. this creates a .json file with all of your blog information. You can find detailed instructions over at ghostforbeginners.com. Save the export.json somewhere accessible!\nMigrate content Go ahead and install ghostToHugo as mentioned above from here. There are many options to install it but I chose to use the go tooling for it. Go ahead and open a terminal and type go get -u github.com/jbarone/ghostToHugo\nNow it’s as easy as running ghostToHugo export.json. I had to play with the dateformat a bit as my blog apparently didn’t use the default, but you can figure that out if your blog is different. You can configure this with the -d flag in ghostToHugo This will create a new hugo site and will put all of your ghost posts in the content folder. Copy these to your new content folder from the previous site setup and you could be good to go from here.\nPersonally, I wanted a bit more organization in my posts. I don’t have a lot, but I have enough where a flat structure wasn’t working for me. Spend some time here organizing your posts structure for your own sanity down the line. I chose to organize my posts with a content/posts/:year/:slug.md structure.\nHugo is probably refreshing itself so you can see your posts showing up at localhost:1313 as long as your server is still running\nFor backwards-compatibility… I have literally one post that anyone ever finds on google. It’s my post on react and indexeddb and it generates an ok number of clicks a week so I don’t want it to get de-ranked. My ghost blog had a very simple permalink setup: /:slug. Luckily, in ghost I can configure the same thing! In config.toml I added\n[permalinks] posts = \"/:slug/\" and just like that, my posts are all configured the exact same as my old ghost blog. You can play around with that to fit your own use-case.\nNow What? You could be hacky and just initialize your github repo in the public/* folder, add the contents and push… but we’re devs and we like to make things automated and slick.\nGitHub setup We are going to need…\na repo for your blog’s source control. I chose github.com/jimdhughes/blog (it’s private) a repo for your published site. I chose github.com/jimdhughes/jimdhughes.github.io the .github.io is very important. A secret Token that gives you repo permissions in your account. This will need to be added to the repo identified by #1 a Github action to build and deploy your static site :) Let’s do it! Steps 1 and two are pretty straight forward. Add your hugo site to the repo in #1 and leave the repo from #2 empty.\nCreate a new personal access token here: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new with repo control. It’s going to give you a token. You need to copy this as you’re going to set it up in your project repo.\nIn your project repo, add a ‘secret’ in github.com/{yourusername}/{yourrepo}/settings/security/secrets called ‘TOKEN’ and paste the value from step 2\nAdd a build.yml file in .github/workflows\n#build.yml name: CI on: push jobs: deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-18.04 steps: - name: Git checkout uses: actions/checkout@v2 - name: Update theme run: git submodule update --init --recursive - name: Setup hugo uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2 with: hugo-version: \"0.64.0\" - name: Build run: hugo --minify - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: personal_token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }} external_repository: / publish_dir: ./public user_name: user_email: publish_branch: master Make sure to replace all the in the above yml file with actual info. You can see we make use of a few github actions by peaceiris and that token we created gets used here to publish your page.\nCommit all this code and push it to master and then watch the magic happen :) An action will be triggered which will build your hugo static site and push all the assets to your .github.io repository. Navigate to .github.io and you can see the delight that is your static website!\nAdding a custom domain The last step in my migration was to add a custom domain to github pages. To do this you need to do a couple things.\nLog in to your DNS and remove the A Record for your subdomain and add a CNAME record of .github.io Once the DNS has propagated, go to the repo of your .github.io Press Settings go down to Github Pages under custom domain, add the name of your domain (mine was blog.jimdhughes.com) Once github finds the cname reference in your DNS, it will generate SSL certs. I elected to ’enforce SSL’ because I think it’s good practice. This will redirect all http requests to your blog to https. To ensure that the CNAME takes on each deploy, add a static file called CNAME to the static folder of your repo and put the cname you want in there. For instance, my static/CNAME folder has blog.jimdhughes.com saved in it.\nThat’s it! A bit of effort and I’ve made my blog a little simpler and saved myself $5 USD / month (which is like $10000 CDN/mo) and I think it feels just a little bit snappier.\nCheers!\n","wordCount":"1450","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2020-07-01T09:02:12-06:00","dateModified":"2020-07-01T09:02:12-06:00","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://blog.jimdhughes.com/posts/2020/migrating-my-blog-from-ghost-to-hugo/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"James Hughes","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://blog.jimdhughes.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://blog.jimdhughes.com/ accesskey=h title="James Hughes (Alt + H)">James Hughes</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Migrating my Blog from Ghost to Hugo</h1><div class=post-description>For Canada Day, I decided to migrate my blog from Ghost to Hugo.
