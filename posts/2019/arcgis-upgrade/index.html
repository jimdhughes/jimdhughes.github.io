We encountered an issue with the account ArcGIS was using to run itself - the LocalSystem account. We don&rsquo;t have passwords for it, so the installer would not let us proceed. We couldn&rsquo;t change the user either which posed a bit of an issue so we decided to just cancel our install and proceed along our merry way.
So we turned our ArcGIS Server service back on and gave it a few minutes to spin back up however it never did!
