I learned to memorize by reading and writing paper content
I learned to look up using digital content.
I find myself continually using indexing and ctrl-f to find information in digital content whereas I actually read and commit to memory when I read physical text and write physical notes.</p><p>Lessons I learned once and apparently have forgotten since</p><hr><p>Yep. Awkward, right?</p><p>Hear me out.</p><p>I&rsquo;m studying for my PMP exam (finally) and up until now I&rsquo;ve been using PDF&rsquo;s and the like to read and jot down notes.</p><p>Here I am, 20 days out from my test and the lesson I <em>should have</em> learned in University has reared it&rsquo;s ugly head again. I can&rsquo;t memorize things digitally.</p><p>In University I spent my first year, like many others, claiming I needed a laptop to make me more productive and to help me make good notes. By year 3 my laptop rarely breached my backpack (except for programming assignments and research) as all my notes and all my flash-cards and the like were <strong>HAND WRITTEN</strong></p><p>This is a point that&rsquo;s hard to make for a guy who makes his living with technology. Maybe it&rsquo;s generational. Maybe my children will be able to study via this mechanism and be able to commit to memory. Maybe society and schooling / certifications / etc will evolve past the point of being able to remember but instead reward the ability of <em>recall</em></p><p>I was driving home from work and was trying to think why this was a thing (anything to defer from actual studying) and I think that I came up with the reason why.</p><p>My first memories of search engines were from either late elementary or early junior high when I used the &lsquo;advanced&rsquo; methods of searching on Altavista and Ask Jeeves and felt like a boss. Google eventually came about and replaced all my awesome complex searching abilities with way simpler and way more accurate plain text search. I had already had half of my academic life completed and relied on writing, reading text, and relying on <em>remembering</em> since it wasn&rsquo;t so easy to simply search for an answer.</p><p>This is why I believe that, for me at least, studying and reading paper is more effective. I&rsquo;ve always used (and use to this day) digital notes and digital content as a <em>reference</em> for when I need to <em>look something up</em>. I was reading my copy of the PMBoK and found myself <strong>incessantly</strong> hitting ctrl-f and typing in keywords to navigate me around the document. I learned which section (ish) to find the information I was looking for and I learned what patterns I was looking for, but I obviously haven&rsquo;t <em>memorized</em> any of this information.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve read some articles that talk about the benefits of print over digital..
