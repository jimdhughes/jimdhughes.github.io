I first started my blog in an attempt to &lsquo;practice what I preach&rsquo; to my peers and young minds that I was hoping to help mould for the best. I think that every developer should have their own blog. Not in a vain attempt to get clicks or ad revenue, but to keep a log of that tough-to-diagnose error that they tried for weeks to diagnose and fix. My blog acts a lot as a personal reference for issues I&rsquo;ve faced in my coding life and what I did to get around them.</p><p>In a silly attempt to get approved for google ads, I deleted several very helpful-for-me posts that google flagged as being too short to allow me to enable ads on my site for. So I deleted them. This is the only real regret I have in my blogging life.</p><p><strong>ANYWAYS</strong></p><p>That&rsquo;s why I blog. This is also partially the reason why I&rsquo;ve switched from Ghost to Hugo. I was hoping to set up google ads on my blog to help pay for my hosting costs. Since I couldn&rsquo;t get approved for ads, I started exploring different paths.</p><h1 id=github-pages>Github Pages</h1><p><a href=https://pages.github.com target=_blank>Github Pages</a> is an offering that allows you to publish a website using git. The name pretty much says it all. The best part: It&rsquo;s free! The genearl idea is:</p><ol><li>Create a new repository that looks like [yourusername].github.io</li><li>Clone the repo</li><li>Add an <code>index.html</code> file with some content</li><li>Commit and push</li><li>Navigate to [yourusername].github.io and boom, you have a website!</li></ol><p>Based on my understanding, github pages does a great job at hosting up static html files. Since my current blog runs on Ghost which is a client/server architecture, I would need to migrate my blog to a static site generator so I can make use of Github Pages.</p><p>Since I have fallen in lust with go, and Hugo is, by their own definition</p><blockquote><p>The world’s fastest framework for building websites</p></blockquote><p>I decided to give it a go!</p><h1 id=setting-up-hugo>Setting up Hugo</h1><p>Since I use my macbook for everything non work-related, I used homebrew to install hugo. There are several installation options <a href=https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/ target=_blank>located on hugo&rsquo;s official getting started pages</a> but I elected to use the trusty homebrew option.</p><pre><code>brew install hugo
</code></pre><p>Once that&rsquo;s all done, you can create a new site by running</p><pre><code>hugo new site myepicblog
</code></pre><p>Next you should initialize your git repo and add a theme. I&rsquo;m using the theme <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/ target=_blank>hugo-notepadium</a>. You can either clone the themes and commit them with your code or use the snazzy <code>git submodules</code> to load it up during your build phase. I elect to load it during the build phase.</p><pre><code>git submodule add https://github.com/cntrump/hugo-notepadium.git themes/hugo-notepadium
</code></pre><p>You can see what you&rsquo;ve got happening by running <code>hugo server</code> and navigating to <code>localhost:1313</code> You should see a static site and some content. Sweet! Our Hugo site is running.</p><h1 id=migrating-content>Migrating content</h1><p>I started to cringe at the idea of manually moving my content from Ghost to Hugo. Ghost&rsquo;s content is stored as markdown Hugo&rsquo;s page setup is, as expected, all stored in Markdown while Ghost relies on a database to organize content. Luckily the community came to the rescue! <a href=https://gohugo.io/tools/migrations/ target=_blank>Ghost provides a list of tools</a> developed by the community to help you migrate from different engines to hugo. Luckily, <a href=https://github.com/jbarone/ghostToHugo target=_blank>ghostToHugo</a> was there to save my day.</p><h2 id=snag-a-backup-of-your-ghost-blog>Snag a backup of your ghost blog</h2><p>Log in to the admin portion of your ghost blog and perform a backup. this creates a <code>.json</code> file with all of your blog information. You can find detailed instructions over at <a href=https://www.ghostforbeginners.com/backup-ghost/ target=_blank>ghostforbeginners.com</a>. Save the export.json somewhere accessible!</p><p>I installed it to my gopath using <code>go get -u github.com/jbarone/ghostToHugo</code></p><p>Now it&rsquo;s as easy as running <code>ghostToHugo export.json</code>. I had to play with the dateformat a bit as my blog apparently didn&rsquo;t use the default - but you can figure that out if your blog is different. You can configure this with the <code>-d</code> flag in <code>ghostToHugo</code> This will create a new hugo site and will put all of your ghost posts in the <code>content</code> folder. Copy these to your new <code>content</code> folder from the previous site setup and you could be good to go from here.</p><p>For me, I wanted a <em>bit</em> more organization in my posts. I don&rsquo;t have a lot, but I have enough where a flat structure wasn&rsquo;t working for me. Spend some time here organizing your posts structure for your own sanity down the line. I chose to organize my posts with a <code>content/posts/:year/:slug.md</code> structure.</p><p>Hugo is probably refreshing itself so you can see your posts showing up at <code>localhost:1313</code> as long as your server is still running</p><h2 id=for-backwards-compatibility>For backwards-compatibility&mldr;</h2><p>I have literally one post that anyone ever finds on google. It&rsquo;s my post on <a href=https://blog.jimdhughes.com/indexeddb-react target=_blank>react and indexeddb</a> and it generates an ok number of clicks a week so I don&rsquo;t want it to get de-ranked. My ghost blog had a very simple permalink setup: <code>/:slug</code>. Luckily, in ghost I can configure the same thing! In <code>config.toml</code> I added</p><pre><code>[permalinks]
  posts = &quot;/:slug/&quot;
</code></pre><p>and just like that, my posts are all configured the exact same as my old ghost blog. You can play around with that to fit your own use-case.</p><h2 id=now-what>Now What?</h2><p>You could be hacky and just initialize your github repo in the <code>public/*</code> folder, add the contents and push&mldr; but we&rsquo;re devs and we like to make things automated and slick.</p><h1 id=github-setup>GitHub setup</h1><p>We are going to need&mldr;</p><ol><li>a repo for your blog&rsquo;s source control. I chose <code>github.com/jimdhughes/blog</code> (it&rsquo;s private)</li><li>a repo for your published site. I chose <code>github.com/jimdhughes/jimdhughes.github.io</code><ul><li>the <code>.github.io</code> is very important.</li></ul></li></ol></article><section class="article labels"><a class=category href=/categories/blog/>Blog</a><a class=tag href=/tags/hugo/>Hugo</a><a class=tag href=/tags/ghost/>Ghost</a></section></div><div class="article bottom"><section class="article navigation"><p><a class=link href=/nasa-has-an-api/><span class="iconfont icon-article"></span>NASA has an API!</a></p></section></div></section><section id=footer><div class=footer-wrap><p class=copyright>©2020 James Hughes.</p><p class=powerby><span>Powered by </span><a href=https://gohugo.io target=_blank>Hugo</a><span> and the </span><a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/ target=_blank>Notepadium</a></p></div></section><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=false;if(!doNotTrack){window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)};ga.l=+new Date;ga('create','UA-61647183-1','auto');ga('send','pageview');}</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script></body></html>
